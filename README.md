## Description
This E-Commerce Backend project defines an API for a hypothetical online retailer to better understand the basic structure of such websites. This application connects with MySQL through Sequelize and is capable of running (CRUD) operations. The routes allow the user to view, create, update, or delete from either the available categories, products, or tags.

## Installation
In order to install this application onto your local machine you would first need to clone the repository to your local enviornment. Install the necessary dependencies, run "npm run seed" in the terminal and then run "npm start".

## Usage
After the application is running you will want to open up a workspace in insomnia or build a simple front end to querry the api. Use "http//localhost:3002/api/categories" to interact with the categories, use "/api/products" to interact with the products and "api/tags" to interact with the tags.

## Contributing
Starting code for this project was obtained from https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/fantastic-umbrella. The rest of the code was written by me! I am not looking for any additional contributions to this project at this time but feel free to reach out or clone the repository for yourself.

## Tests
Use insomnia to test the routes as described in the usage section.
